## What I do

Microsofts Power Platform promises to accelerate business processes, closing gaps between applications and business needs and empower employees. 

I don’t only demonstrate achievable quick wins but focus on an overall strategy to sustainably implement the concept of continuous citizen development throughout the organisation.

To achieve that I will introduce a detailed multi step plan covering/including re-evaluating and modernizing legacy processes, implementing a governance and security concept and enabling everyone to contribute to organizational objectives. This way Power Platform serves as a catalyst for employee’s productivity, by taking away repetitive tasks and freeing up time to focus on meaningful work.

## What I think

Let’s get rid of the bullshit jobs and keep focusing on what makes us irreplaceable: genuine human uniqueness, creativity and kindness 
Every one of us is unique in their own special way and that leads to so many creative and wild solutions. I strongly believe that everyone can benefit if we include everybody. I want people to be able to contribute and express their ideas.
